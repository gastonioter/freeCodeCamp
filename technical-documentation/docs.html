          Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed
          by Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation)
          and released in 1995. It was designed with the intent to be
          platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device
          that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the
          underlying hardware and software platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, which
          means that Java code can be written on one platform and run on any
          other platform without modification. This is made possible by the JVM,
          which interprets Java bytecode and translates it into machine code
          that can be executed by the host system.

        <p>To install Java, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle
            website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose the appropriate version of the JDK for your operating system
            (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on the download link to start the download process. You may
            need to create an Oracle account to download the JDK.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file on your
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Double-click on the downloaded file to start the installation
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the installation is complete, you can start using Java to
            develop and run Java applications on your computer.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For more detailed instructions on how to install Java, refer to the
          official Java documentation on the Oracle website.

      <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>
          The "Hello, World!" program is a simple program that displays the text
          "Hello, World!" on the screen. It is often used as the first program
          to write when learning a new programming language. Here is an example
          of the "Hello, World!" program in Java:
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
          public class HelloWorld {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println("Hello, World!");
            }
          }
        </code>

    </pre>
        <p>
          The program consists of a single class called HelloWorld with a single
          method called main. The main method is the entry point of the program
          and is where the program starts executing. The main method uses the
          System.out.println method to print the text "Hello, World!" to the
          console.
        </p>
        <p>To run the "Hello, World!" program, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open a text editor and copy the code above into a new file.</li>
          <li>Save the file with a .java extension (e.g., HelloWorld.java).</li>
          <li>
            Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the
            directory where you saved the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compile the program by running the following command:
            <code>javac HelloWorld.java</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the program by running the following command:
            <code>java HelloWorld</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions in Java are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
          They are defined using the <code>public static</code> keywords
          followed by the return type of the function, the name of the function,
          and any parameters that the function takes. Here is an example of a
          function that adds two numbers together:
        </p>
        <pre>
                <code>
                public class AddNumbers {
                    public static int add(int a, int b) {
                    return a + b;
                    }
                }
                </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          To use the <code>add</code> function in another part of your program,
          you can call it like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
                <code>
                int sum = AddNumbers.add(5, 3);
                System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
                </code>
        </pre>
